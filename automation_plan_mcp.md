# Notion Life OS Automation Plan (MCP Tools Only)

This document outlines the revised plan to automate the population of your Notion Life OS, using only the available MCP tools. This approach is more "on-demand" than fully automatic.

**Prerequisite:** This plan relies on command-line interface (CLI) tools like `gcalcli` for Google Calendar. These tools would need to be installed and authorized on your local machine for me to use them via shell commands.

## Feature 1: On-Demand Calendar Sync

**Goal:** Sync all of a given day's calendar events to your Notion "Tasks" and "Timesheet" databases with a single command.

**Your Command:** "Sync my calendar for today."

**My Workflow:**
1.  **Execute Shell Command:** I will run a command like `gcalcli agenda --tsv` to fetch all calendar events in a structured format.
2.  **Process Events:** I will parse the output of that command and loop through each event.
3.  **Notion Actions (for each event):**
    *   **Find Project:** Search your "Projects" database for a related project.
    *   **Create Task:** Create a new task in your "Tasks" database, setting the name, date, and project link.
    *   **Create Timesheet Entry:** Create a corresponding entry in your "Timesheet" database with the correct start/end times, linked to the new task.

## Feature 2: On-Demand Toggl & Workout Sync

**Goal:** Sync your Toggl time entries and workout logs on demand.

### Toggl Workflow:
*   **Your Command:** "Import my Toggl entries from yesterday."
*   **My Workflow:** Similar to the calendar sync, I would use a Toggl CLI to get a structured list of your time entries and then create the corresponding items and relationships in Notion.

### Workout Workflow:
*   This is the most manual part of the MCP-only approach.
*   **Your Command:** You would paste the workout data directly into the chat. For example: "Log my workout: 45-minute run, 5km."
*   **My Workflow:** I will parse the text you provide and create the appropriate "Task" (Type: Exercise) and "Timesheet" entries in Notion.

## Feature 3: AI-Powered Journaling & Reviews

This feature already relies on my native ability to understand your natural language commands, query your Notion databases, and create or summarize content.

### Use Case 1: Conversational Journaling
*   **Interaction:** You can send a message like: "Journal entry: I had a great brainstorming session for the 'Q3 Marketing' project."
*   **My Action:** I will parse the text, create a new entry in your "Journals" database, and automatically link it to the correct project.

### Use Case 2: On-Demand Summaries & Reviews
*   **Interaction:** You can ask me questions like: "Summarize my progress on the 'Website Redesign' project this week."
*   **My Action:** I will query your Notion databases, synthesize the information, and provide you with a concise summary directly in the chat or on a new Notion page.
